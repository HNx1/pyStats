# sparseStats

- Lightweight implementations of various statistical learning methods, using as
  close to pure python as possible
- We focus on classifier methods mostly as they tend to be slightly more complex in implementation than the regression equivalent.

## List of methods to date

- in trees.py Bagging, Random Forest, AdaBoost/SAMME

## Credits for some ideas/structure used in code

- Jason Brownlee
